# Challenges

1. Group members had other commitments (work, appointments) not related to the project and it lead to cutting meetings short.

* Communicating with members when available through group chats and sharing ideas outside meetings.

2. It was difficult to find an available library group study room at a time when everyone was available.

* We all told each other on a group chat when we would all be free. As well as this booking a week in advance
meant that more time slots were available for us to choose from.

3. It was difficult to make the two sets of questions flow together well and not seem disjointed

*Arrange a time and work together in creating the questions
*On completion of the questions send them straight away to remaining members of the group for validation
